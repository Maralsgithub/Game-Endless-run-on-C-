# C-Endless-Runner-T-Rex-Game
C# simple endless runner T-Rex game in Windows Form and Visual  Studio
In this project I made a simple endless runner similar to the dinosaur game from chrome browser. This is a endless runner so the objective of this game is to jump over the obstacles and score as high as possible.

I have made this game in visual studio with windows form and c# programming language. In this game I have used label, picture boxes and timer. You will go over some of the core programming techniques such as resetting the game so you can play again, timer event, key down and key up event inside of windows form. Its a fun little game to practice programming with. I hope you find it useful.
